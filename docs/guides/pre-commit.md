# Pre-commit Integration

greybeard can run as a pre-commit hook, reviewing staged changes before a commit lands.
This gives fast feedback at the source — before CI, before review, before anything else.

---

## How It Works

```
git commit → pre-commit framework → greybeard-precommit diff/check
                                         ↓
                                  staged diff analyzed
                                         ↓
                              concerns below threshold → commit proceeds
                              concerns at/above threshold → commit blocked
```

Configuration lives in a per-repo `.greybeard-precommit.yaml` file that the hook reads
on every run. The file controls which risk gates apply, which packs run, and whether hooks
are active at all.

---

## Setup

### 1. Add the hook to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/btotharye/greybeard
    rev: v0.7.0 # pin to a specific release tag — see "Version pinning" below
    hooks:
      - id: greybeard-precommit-diff
        args: [--pack, staff-core]
```

### 2. Create `.greybeard-precommit.yaml` in your repo root

```yaml
enabled: true
default_pack: staff-core
fail_on_concerns: high

risk_gates:
  - name: security-critical
    patterns:
      - "auth/**"
      - "**/*secret*"
      - "**/*token*"
    fail_on_concerns: critical
    required_packs:
      - security-reviewer
    skip_if_branch:
      - "^hotfix/"
      - "^emergency/"
```

**Commit this file.** It is repo configuration, not personal preference. Tracking it in
source control ensures every developer (and CI) uses the same gate definitions.

### 3. Install hooks

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### 4. Verify configuration

```bash
greybeard-precommit config show
```

This prints the active config without running a review — useful to confirm gates loaded
correctly after editing `.greybeard-precommit.yaml`.

---

## Risk Gates

A risk gate is a named policy that applies greybeard checks to a specific subset of files,
at a specific concern threshold, using a specific set of packs.

### Gate fields

| Field              | Required | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`             | ✅       | Human-readable name for the gate                                                                                   |
| `patterns`         | ✅       | File glob patterns that trigger this gate                                                                          |
| `fail_on_concerns` | –        | Block commit at this concern level or above (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`). Defaults to repo-level setting. |
| `required_packs`   | –        | Packs that must run for this gate. Defaults to `default_pack`.                                                     |
| `skip_if_branch`   | –        | Regex patterns — skip gate entirely on matching branches.                                                          |

### Example: layered gates by sensitivity

```yaml
enabled: true
default_pack: staff-core
fail_on_concerns: high # default: block on high or critical

risk_gates:
  - name: infra-changes
    patterns:
      - "terraform/**"
      - "k8s/**"
      - "helm/**"
    fail_on_concerns: medium # stricter for infra
    required_packs:
      - oncall-future-you
      - security-reviewer

  - name: auth-and-secrets
    patterns:
      - "auth/**"
      - "**/*secret*"
      - "**/*credential*"
    fail_on_concerns: critical # only block on critical for auth code
    required_packs:
      - security-reviewer

  - name: docs-only
    patterns:
      - "docs/**"
      - "*.md"
    fail_on_concerns: none # never block doc-only commits
```

### Emergency bypass (`skip_if_branch`)

Branches matching the patterns in `skip_if_branch` completely skip the gate. This is
intentional — hotfix and incident branches should not be blocked by greybeard.

```yaml
risk_gates:
  - name: infra-changes
    patterns:
      - "terraform/**"
    skip_if_branch:
      - "^hotfix/"
      - "^incident/"
      - "^emergency/"
```

The patterns are Python regexes matched against the current branch name.

---

## False Positives and Alert Fatigue

The most common misconfiguration is a gate set to `fail_on_concerns: low` with broad file
patterns. This blocks commits for innocuous reasons — a `TODO: reduce risk` comment, a
variable named `concern_level`, or a docstring mentioning "security considerations".

### Calibrate thresholds correctly

`fail_on_concerns` maps directly to the concern level in the LLM's review output:

| Level      | Blocks on…                                     | When to use                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `critical` | Critical concerns only                         | Hotfix branches, legacy codebases |
| `high`     | High and critical concerns (**recommended**)   | Most application code             |
| `medium`   | Medium, high, and critical                     | Sensitive paths (infra, auth)     |
| `low`      | Everything — **very noisy, avoid for commits** | Reporting only, not commit gating |
| `none`     | Never blocks                                   | Docs, generated files             |

Start with `fail_on_concerns: high` at the repo level. Raise it to `medium` only for
specific high-risk gates. Never set `low` on a gate that applies to generic source files.

### Exclude noisy paths

```yaml
# .greybeard-precommit.yaml
excluded_paths:
  - "vendor/**"
  - "third_party/**"
  - "**/*_generated.go"
  - "**/*.pb.py" # protobuf generated code
  - "migrations/**" # if your team reviews these separately
```

### Mark doc-only and test paths as non-blocking

```yaml
risk_gates:
  - name: docs-and-tests
    patterns:
      - "docs/**"
      - "*.md"
      - "tests/**"
      - "**/*_test.py"
    fail_on_concerns: none # informational only — never blocks
```

### Skip a single commit (not the whole repo)

If a commit is safe but a gate is incorrectly flagging it, use the pre-commit framework's
built-in per-commit skip. This does not change any config and leaves no persistent trace:

```bash
SKIP=greybeard-precommit-diff git commit -m "feat: my safe change"
```

This should be used sparingly and not as a routine workaround. If you're reaching for
`SKIP=` regularly, the gate threshold is wrong — fix the config instead.

### Track false positive rate

If developers are routinely using `SKIP=` or complaining about blocked commits:

1. Run `greybeard-precommit diff --verbose` on recent false-positive commits to see
   exactly what triggered the gate.
2. Adjust the gate's `fail_on_concerns` up, or narrow its `patterns`.
3. Record the change in the YAML comments (see [Ownership Model](#ownership-model)).
4. PR the gate change with the owner as a required reviewer.

---

## Reading the Output

When a commit is blocked, greybeard prints:

```
✗ Review failed — commit blocked

<brief summary from the LLM>

Concerns:
  • [HIGH] Authentication tokens stored without expiry
  • [HIGH] Missing input validation on user_id parameter

Failed gates: auth-and-secrets

What to do:
  1. Address the concerns above and re-commit.
  2. Run greybeard-precommit diff --verbose to see the full review.
  3. If this is a false positive, open a PR to adjust the gate in
     .greybeard-precommit.yaml.
  4. To skip this commit only (use sparingly):
     SKIP=greybeard-precommit-diff git commit -m '...'
  5. To disable all greybeard hooks immediately, set enabled: false
     in .greybeard-precommit.yaml.
```

**Interpreting the concerns list:**

- Concerns are extracted directly from the LLM's structured output — they reflect the
  reviewer's reasoning, not just keyword matches.
- The list shows up to 5 concerns. Run `--verbose` to see all of them and the full
  review text.
- `Failed gates:` tells you which gate triggered, so you know exactly which rule to
  look at in `.greybeard-precommit.yaml`.

---

## Ownership Model

`.greybeard-precommit.yaml` is **platform/infra team configuration**, not personal tooling.

### Who should own it?

Whoever owns the repo's other developer tooling and CI configuration owns this file:

- Platform team / DX team for shared repos
- The backend team lead for service repos
- The individual developer for personal/side-project repos

If you don't have a clear owner, default to: whoever merges changes to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Version-control the file

```
.greybeard-precommit.yaml   ← commit this
.greybeard-precommit.local.yaml  ← gitignore this (if you need developer overrides)
```

Add the local override file to `.gitignore` so developers can temporarily adjust their
own settings without affecting the shared config.

### Keep a brief runbook (as code comments or a wiki page)

When gates change, the change should be reviewable. A suggested minimal note:

```yaml
# .greybeard-precommit.yaml
# Owner: platform-team / @your-handle
# Last reviewed: 2026-03
# Purpose: block high-risk commits before they reach CI
#
# To update:
#   1. Edit this file
#   2. Run `greybeard-precommit config show` to verify
#   3. Test with a staged change: git add <file> && greybeard-precommit diff
#   4. PR the change with the platform team as reviewers
enabled: true
```

### Testing gate changes

Before merging a gate change, verify it locally:

```bash
# 1. Show active config
greybeard-precommit config show

# 2. Test against real staged changes
git add path/to/test/file.py
greybeard-precommit diff --pack security-reviewer --verbose

# 3. Test against a specific file without staging
git diff HEAD~1 -- path/to/file.py | greybeard analyze --pack security-reviewer

# 4. Dry-run on all staged changes
greybeard-precommit check --verbose
```

### Rotating or removing a gate

1. Remove or comment out the gate in `.greybeard-precommit.yaml`
2. Run `greybeard-precommit config show` to confirm it's gone
3. Open a PR — reviewers can see the exact gating change in the diff
4. After merge, run `pre-commit run --all-files` to confirm no false positives

---

## Kill Switch

If greybeard is unexpectedly blocking commits (e.g., after a bad release), disable all
hooks immediately without touching `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
# .greybeard-precommit.yaml
enabled: false
```

This is faster than `pre-commit uninstall` and lets you re-enable by changing one line
once the issue is resolved.

For team-wide emergencies, commit `enabled: false`, merge to main, and notify developers
to run `pre-commit autoupdate` or `git pull`.

---

## Version Pinning

Always pin `rev:` to a release tag in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/btotharye/greybeard
    rev: v0.7.0 # ✅ pinned release
    # rev: main   # ❌ never — a bad commit breaks every developer's workflow
```

To update the pin:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate --repo https://github.com/btotharye/greybeard
```

This updates to the latest release tag. Review the changelog before merging.

## Configuration Reference

Full schema for `.greybeard-precommit.yaml`. All fields are optional — sensible defaults apply.

```yaml
# .greybeard-precommit.yaml

# Master on/off switch. Set to false to disable all hooks immediately.
enabled: true

# Default pack name used when no gate-specific pack is configured.
# Valid values: staff-core, oncall-future-you, security-reviewer, or a path
# to a custom pack YAML.
default_pack: staff-core

# Additional packs to run alongside default_pack on every commit.
additional_packs: []

# Concern level that blocks a commit at the repo level.
# Gate-level fail_on_concerns overrides this for matched files.
# Options: none | critical | high | medium | low
fail_on_concerns: high

# Skip commits where nothing is staged (git add was not run).
skip_unstaged: true

# Maximum number of diff lines to send to the LLM.
# Larger values increase cost and latency; smaller values may miss context.
max_context_lines: 500

# Print debug output (staged files, pack name, gate matches).
verbose: false

# Allow committing with no staged changes (useful in CI pipelines).
allow_empty_commits: false

# Glob patterns excluded from all reviews.
excluded_paths:
  - "vendor/**"
  - "node_modules/**"
  - "*.lock"
  - "*.pb.py"

# Risk gates — zero or more named policies.
risk_gates:
  - name: string # Required. Human-readable gate name.

    patterns: # Required. Glob patterns that activate this gate.
      - "auth/**"

    fail_on_concerns: high # Optional. Overrides repo-level fail_on_concerns.

    required_packs: # Optional. Specific packs for this gate.
      - security-reviewer

    skip_if_branch: # Optional. Python regex patterns. Gate is skipped on
      - "^hotfix/" # branches whose name matches any pattern here.
      - "^emergency/"
```

All string values in `patterns` and `skip_if_branch` use Python `fnmatch` glob syntax
(patterns) or `re` regex syntax (skip_if_branch).

## Troubleshooting

**`greybeard-precommit: command not found`**

The hook binary isn't on the PATH. Make sure greybeard is installed in the same
environment pre-commit uses:

```bash
pip install "greybeard[anthropic]"
# or
uv tool install "greybeard[anthropic]"
```

**Gate is triggering on the wrong files**

Check your glob patterns with `greybeard-precommit config show`.
Patterns use standard Python `fnmatch`/`glob` syntax — `**` requires Python 3.5+ glob.

**Commit blocked — what do I do?**

Read the `Concerns:` section in the output — it lists the specific issues found.
Run `greybeard-precommit diff --verbose` for the full review. If the block is correct,
fix the code. If it's a false positive, use `SKIP=greybeard-precommit-diff` for this
commit and open a PR to tune the gate threshold.

**Gate is blocking on a word like "risk" or "concern" in a comment**

This is a false positive. The LLM-based reviewer evaluates the actual code change, not
individual keywords — but gates with broad file patterns and low thresholds can still
produce noise. Raise `fail_on_concerns` to `high` or `critical` for the triggering gate,
or add the file to `excluded_paths`. See [False Positives](#false-positives-and-alert-fatigue).

**Commit blocked unexpectedly after a greybeard update**

Use the kill switch ([see above](#kill-switch)) and file a bug with the review output
that was incorrectly flagged.

**How do I let one developer bypass gates without changing the shared config?**

Add a local override file (not tracked):

```yaml
# .greybeard-precommit.local.yaml  (gitignored)
enabled: false
```

Then set `GREYBEARD_PRECOMMIT_CONFIG=.greybeard-precommit.local.yaml` in their shell.
